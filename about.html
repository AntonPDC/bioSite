          <h2>Penny's Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Penny’s journey is one of resilience, love, and self-discovery.
            Motherhood has been her most transformative experience, shaping her
            values and deepening her empathy. A defining moment came when her
            eldest daughter, Remy, was hospitalized shortly after the birth of
            her second child, Piper. Though she knew Remy was safe with her
            grandmother, the pain of not being with her was overwhelming,
            reinforcing the depth of her love and commitment as a mother. This
            experience strengthened her understanding of the sacrifices and
            emotional complexities that come with parenthood, shaping how she
            prioritizes her children’s well-being. She hopes to instill
            kindness, integrity, and empathy in her children, encouraging them
            to make ethical choices while embracing life’s joys. She wants them
            to be good people, treat others with compassion, and also be kind to
            themselves. Penny understands that childhood is the foundation for
            lifelong character, and she takes her role in guiding them
            seriously. She also believes in the importance of enjoying life,
            ensuring that her children learn to find happiness in both small and
            significant moments.

            Beyond motherhood, Penny’s love for reading has been a lifelong
            passion. As a child, she stayed up late under the covers with a book
            light, eager to absorb stories. One of her favorite memories was
            winning a summer reading challenge in fourth grade, earning her the
            chance to throw a pie at a teacher in front of the whole school. If
            she had to pick one book that profoundly impacted her, it would be
            The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls. Though the book does not mirror
            her own life exactly, its portrayal of growing up in rural
            Appalachia resonates with her deeply. Cooking is another passion,
            providing her with moments of peace and creativity. She enjoys
            putting on a podcast while preparing meals, making cooking feel like
            “me time.” She finds joy in organizing and preparing a well-balanced
            meal, and the process provides a dopamine boost that adds to her
            sense of fulfillment. Pasta is her go-to dish—simple, versatile, and
            satisfying. While she balances motherhood with her interests, she
            understands this phase of life is temporary. Right now, much of her
            time is devoted to raising her children, but she embraces this
            season with patience. Looking ahead, Penny’s greatest goal is to
            live fully in the moment with her children, cherishing every memory
            while embracing the lessons that life continues to offer.
